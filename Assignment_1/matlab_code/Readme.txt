my_iir_filter.m ====> is the file containing the matlab code that provides the coefficients, the input waveform to be processed
		      and the output of the filter in floating point, quantized on 14 bits

myiir_design.m ====> is the function that computes the coefficients of the digital filter files generated by matlab

samples.txt ====> is the file containing the average of the two waveforms created in matlab one in band and one out of band

resultsm.txt ====> is the file containing the results of the digital filtering executed in floating point with matlab file 		   generated by C program

output_20.txt ====> is the file containing the results of the fixed point C model of the filter, it is inserted in this folder 		    to do the plot and compare the two results
