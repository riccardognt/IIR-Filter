my_iir_filter_LK.m ====> is the file containing the Matlab code that provides the new coefficients for the look ahead implementation,
				 the input waveform to be processed and the output of the filter in floating point, quantized on 14 bits.

myiir_design.m ====> is the function that computes the coefficients of the digital filter

files generated by Matlab:

samples.txt ====> is the file containing the average of the two waveforms created in matlab one in band and one out of band
resultsm_LK.txt ====> is the file containing the results of the digital filtering with the look-ahead coefficients executed in floating point with Matlab
